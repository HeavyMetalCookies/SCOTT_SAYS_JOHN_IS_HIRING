    Hi! I am John Mark. ( KanjiCoder@Gmail.com : 734.263.0068 )
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Scott Fernandez recommended me.
    
    I've been writing mostly low level C code lately,
    but have professional experience with C# and SQL.
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    
    1. Been coding for 17 years.
    
    Tech Demos Page  : https://d3m0.herokuapp.com/
                      ( The server is free, so you may have )
                      ( to reload the page once if it is    )
                      ( in hybernation mode.                )
                      
    Current  Project : https://github.com/HeavyMetalCookies/A3
    Previous Project : https://github.com/KANJICODER/AAC2020
    
    2. I good with public speaking, and have experience 
       writing code from scratch in front of clients.
       
    3. For part time work, I am available as an employee.
       For full time work, payment it due to DEKAZEHN CORP. .
       
    4. I have in the past created sample projects for 
       employers before being hired. I could whip something
       up for you with C# and SQL and deploy it to heroku
       if you need some proof.
       
       I did such a thing before being hired at my last
       company. You can ask my old boss about it.
